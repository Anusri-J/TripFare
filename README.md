**🚕 TripFare: Predicting Urban Taxi Fare with Machine Learning**

A project that uses real-world taxi trip data to analyze patterns and build predictive models for estimating fares.
It transforms raw ride records into clean, feature-rich datasets, applies regression models, and delivers a Streamlit app where users can predict trip fares instantly.

**📌 Project Overview**

This project focuses on:

📍 Understanding taxi trip behaviors through data analysis

💰 Predicting total fare amount based on trip features

📊 Performing EDA to uncover patterns in distance, duration, and passenger counts

🤖 Building and comparing multiple regression models

🖥️ Deploying a Streamlit UI for interactive fare prediction

**🧠 Skills Gained**

🧹 Data cleaning & preprocessing

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Matplotlib & Seaborn

🧾 Feature engineering (distance, time-based, categorical encoding)

🤖 Regression modeling & evaluation (Linear, Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc.)

⚙️ Hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV / RandomizedSearchCV)

🖥️ Streamlit app deployment for end-user interaction

🧩 Steps Involved

**✅ Step 1: Data Collection**

Loaded taxi fare dataset (CSV).

Checked shape, datatypes, duplicates, and missing values.

✅ Step 2: Data Understanding

Explored variables: fare amount, trip distance, passenger count, pickup/dropoff time & location, etc.

✅ Step 3: Feature Engineering
Derived new columns such as:

trip_distance (Haversine formula from pickup & dropoff coordinates)

pickup_day (weekday vs weekend)

am/pm flag

is_night indicator

Converted pickup_datetime to local timezone (EDT).

✅ Step 4: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Fare vs Distance & Passenger Count

Outlier detection (extreme fares, invalid distances)

Peak demand analysis (hour, weekday/weekend)

Impact of late-night and weekend rides on fare

✅ Step 5: Data Transformation

Handled outliers using Z-score / IQR

Fixed skewness in continuous variables

Encoded categorical variables

✅ Step 6: Feature Selection

Correlation analysis

Chi-square tests (categorical features)

Feature importance using Random Forest

✅ Step 7: Model Building & Evaluation

Trained regression models: Linear, Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting

Evaluated with:

R²

MAE, MSE, RMSE

✅ Step 8: Hyperparameter Tuning

Used GridSearchCV/RandomizedSearchCV to optimize model performance

✅ Step 9: Best Model & Deployment

Saved the best model (Pickle format)

Built Streamlit UI where users can enter trip details (pickup/dropoff, passenger count, time, etc.) and get predicted fare instantly

**📊 Sample Insights**

Fare vs Distance → Strong positive correlation, but nonlinear for very long trips


Fare vs Passenger Count → Minimal effect beyond 2 passengers


Night Rides → Higher average fare due to surcharges


Weekends vs Weekdays → Fare patterns fluctuate with demand
